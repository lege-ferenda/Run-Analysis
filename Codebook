The codebook describes the transformation on "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset" (Version 1.0), a dataset which has been produced by Jorge L. Reyes-Ortiz, Davide Anguita, Alessandro Ghio, Luca Oneto.

The data has been collected through experiments and according to the scientific team that published them: " The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 


The original form of the dataset can be found here : https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip .

2. PROCESS

A. Data Input

From the original dataset, the above files have been loaded into R using the read.table() function

-- X_test.txt 
-- y_test.txt
-- X_train.txt
-- y_train.txt
-- subject_test.txt
-- subject_train.txt
-- features.txt
-- activity_labels.txt

B. Data Merge

After the data input, the separate data frames are combined in order to produse a single data frame

The combination follows the above pattern:

-- X_test and X_train rbinded together
-- y-test and y_train rbinded together
-- subject_test and subject_train rbinded together

Then the output of them was cbinded, producing a data frame with 10.299 observations and 563 variables.
